                <h2>STEPHANIE LORRAINE CANLAS</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Stephanie Lorraine M. Canlas.
                    My family and friends call me “Steph.”
                    I am a 20-year-old lady living in Pasong Tamo, Quezon City.
                    I am a college student who is currently pursuing a course in Office Administration at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Manila.
                    My favorite foods are ice cream, strawberry, and carbonara.
                    I really like the color blue.
                    Taylor Swift and SEVENTEEN are my favorite singers.
                    My hobbies are dancing, watching movies or series, singing, listening to music, playing online games, and diamond painting.
                    I consider my Mathematics skills as one of my greatest strengths. 
                    During my time as a high school student, I was one of the students selected from my class to compete in math quiz bees both at our school and at other schools.
                    I also became the president of a math club in the ninth grade. 
                    As for my weaknesses, I find public speaking intimidating, and I am a shy person.
                    I often feel anxious whenever I speak in front of people.
                    So, I am always the quiet one in a group of people.
                    However, I am doing my best to overcome my weaknesses progressively.
                    My ambition in life is to pursue my dream career and to have a simple and happy life.
                    Although things are not always as simple as we would like, giving myself time to enjoy the journey and allowing simplicity to be my companion may lead me to a happy and healthy life.</p>
